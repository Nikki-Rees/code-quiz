I tried to create an object and a loop that would populate a single question and answer div, but i could quite get this to populate correctly so I simplified my code to use incorporate the text elements within the html, and used a display: none / block style to make the elements visible as the user progressed through the quiz

Couldn't get this to work so opted to use html to build quiz and the hide / display elements upon clicks

Also was unsure how to stop the timer upon finishing quiz

I would like to re-do this homework to see if I can get a cleaner solution working.

I have also struggled to get my leader board to render
